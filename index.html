        <p><em><strong>Graphic Designer</strong>, Ex-Game Developer, and Entrepreneur</em></p>
        <p>I started as a graphic designer for a magazine publication but then ended up working in the game development industry.<br><br>
          I was a production manager and a level designer for an indie studio for three years. Afterwards, I spent a couple of years working as a graphic designer
          & production manager for a game development conference that brought together indie and casual game developers.
          I broke away from that in order to start up a small online store. <br><br>
          Today, I am trying to return to my graphic design roots while expanding my skill set by furthering my knowledge of web development.
